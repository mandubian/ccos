# Before vs After: Goal-Agnostic Self-Learning

## üî¥ BEFORE: Broken for Non-Research Goals

### User Command
```bash
RESEARCH_TOPIC="plan a trip to paris" ./demo_smart_assistant.sh full
```

### Questions Asked (Hardcoded)
```
Q1: What domains should I focus on? (e.g., academic, industry, blogs)
Q2: How deep should the analysis be? (e.g., overview, comprehensive)  
Q3: What format do you prefer? (e.g., summary, detailed report)
Q4: Which sources do you trust? (e.g., arxiv, IEEE, ACM, Google Scholar)
Q5: Any time constraints? (e.g., 24 hours, 1 week)
```

**‚ùå Problem:** These questions are about **research**, not **trip planning**!

### Generated Capability
```rtfs
(capability "research.assistant.academic.v1"
  :description "Academic research assistant with preferences for quick overviews from arXiv sources"
  :parameters {:topic "string"}
  :implementation
    (do
      (step "Gather Sources"
        (call :research.gather {:topic topic :sources ["arxiv"]}))
      (step "Analyze"
        (call :research.analyze {:depth "overview"}))
      (step "Synthesize"
        (call :research.synthesize {:format "summary"}))
      (step "Return"
        {:status "completed" :summary result :time_constraint "24h"})))
```

**‚ùå Problem:** Generated a **research capability** for a **trip planning goal**!

---

## üü¢ AFTER: Works for Any Goal

### User Command (Same)
```bash
RESEARCH_TOPIC="plan a trip to paris" ./demo_smart_assistant.sh full
```

### Questions Asked (LLM-Generated)
```
Q1: When are you planning to travel and for how long?
Q2: What is your approximate budget for the trip?
Q3: Who is going on the trip (e.g., solo, couple, family with children)?
Q4: What are your main interests (e.g., art museums, history, food, shopping, architecture)?
Q5: What is your preferred style of accommodation (e.g., luxury hotel, budget hostel, vacation rental)?
```

**‚úÖ Solution:** Questions are **specific to trip planning**!

### Generated Capability
```rtfs
(capability "travel.trip-planner.paris.v1"
  :description "Paris trip planner with user's specific preferences and constraints"
  :parameters {:destination "string" :travel_dates "string" :duration "string" :budget "string" :travel_party "string" :interests "list" :accommodation_style "string"}
  :implementation
    (do
      (step "Research Activities"
        (call :travel.research {:destination destination :interests interests}))
      (step "Find Accommodation"
        (call :travel.hotels {:city destination :budget budget :accommodation_style accommodation_style :duration duration :travel_party travel_party}))
      (step "Plan Transportation"
        (call :travel.transport {:destination destination :travel_dates travel_dates :duration duration :budget budget}))
      (step "Create Daily Itinerary"
        (call :travel.itinerary {:days duration :activities activities :interests interests :travel_party travel_party}))
      (step "Return"
        {:status "completed" :itinerary full_plan :accommodation hotel_results :transportation transport_results})))
```

**‚úÖ Solution:** Generated a **trip planning capability** for a **trip planning goal**!

## üìä Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Question Generation** | Hardcoded in Rust | LLM-generated based on goal |
| **Question Relevance** | Always research-focused | Adapts to goal domain |
| **Capability ID** | Always `research.*` | Matches goal (`travel.*`, `sentiment.*`, etc.) |
| **Capability Steps** | Always research workflow | Domain-appropriate workflow |
| **Extensibility** | Requires code changes | Works out of the box |
| **User Experience** | Confusing for non-research goals | Intuitive for any goal |

## üéØ More Examples

### Example 2: Sentiment Analysis

**Goal:** `RESEARCH_TOPIC="analyze customer sentiment from reviews"`

**Questions (After):**
1. Do you have specific reviews or need to collect them?
2. What timeframe?
3. Simple classification or granular themes?
4. Output format?
5. Track sentiment changes over time?

**Capability:** `sentiment.analyzer.reviews.v1` ‚úÖ

---

### Example 3: Research (Still Works!)

**Goal:** `RESEARCH_TOPIC="quantum computing applications in cryptography"`

**Questions (After):**
1. What domains should I focus on?
2. How deep should the analysis be?
3. What format do you prefer?
4. Which sources do you trust?
5. Any time constraints?

**Capability:** `research.crypto-quantum.v1` ‚úÖ

**Note:** Research still works perfectly, but now other goals work too!

## üîß Technical Changes

### Code: Before
```rust
// Hardcoded questions
let questions = vec![
    "What domains should I focus on?",
    "How deep should the analysis be?",
    "What format do you prefer?",
    "Which sources do you trust?",
    "Any time constraints?",
];
```

### Code: After
```rust
// LLM generates questions
let questions = generate_questions_for_goal(ccos, topic).await?;

// Inside generate_questions_for_goal():
let prompt = format!(
    r#"You are analyzing a user's goal to determine what clarifying questions to ask.

User Goal: "{}"

Generate 5 specific, relevant questions to understand how to best help achieve this goal.
The questions should gather preferences, constraints, and requirements specific to THIS goal.

IMPORTANT: Generate questions appropriate for the ACTUAL goal, not generic research questions."#,
    goal
);
```

## üí° Key Insight

**Before:** System was **domain-specific** (research only)
**After:** System is **domain-agnostic** (any goal)

This was achieved by:
1. ‚úÖ Using LLM for question generation (not hardcoding)
2. ‚úÖ Emphasizing "ACTUAL GOAL" in synthesis prompt
3. ‚úÖ Providing diverse examples (trip planning, not just research)
4. ‚úÖ Generic preference extraction (works across domains)

## üéì Conclusion

This transformation demonstrates the power of **LLM-driven meta-programming** in CCOS/RTFS:

- LLMs can **reason about** goals ‚Üí generate questions
- LLMs can **synthesize** capabilities ‚Üí create workflows
- RTFS provides **structure** ‚Üí enables reliable execution
- CCOS provides **governance** ‚Üí ensures safety

The result is a truly **adaptive system** that learns and creates capabilities for any domain!
