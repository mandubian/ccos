## üîç Evidence of Completion

### Arbiter System
- ‚úÖ Implementation: `rtfs_compiler/src/ccos/arbiter/` (266KB of code)
- ‚úÖ Completion Report: `docs/archive/rtfs_compiler/ISSUE_23_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- ‚úÖ All M1-M5 milestones delivered

### Execution Context
- ‚úÖ Implementation: `rtfs_compiler/src/ccos/execution_context.rs` (24KB)
- ‚úÖ Completion Report: `docs/archive/rtfs_compiler/ISSUE_79_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- ‚úÖ Full test coverage

### RTFS Stability
- ‚úÖ All child issues closed: #109, #110, #111, #112, #113, #114
- ‚úÖ Documentation: `docs/archive/rtfs-2.0/specs-before-migration/RTFS_STABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## üî¨ Issues Requiring Further Review (10)

See `ISSUE_151_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` for detailed analysis of:
- MicroVM & Agent Isolation (#63-67)
- Orchestrator parameter binding (#13, #80)
- Tracking & organization (#120)

## üìù Methodology

Issues were marked for closure only when:
1. ‚úÖ Completion reports exist in `/docs/archive/`
2. ‚úÖ Implementation evidence found in codebase
3. ‚úÖ All child issues closed (for umbrella issues)
4. ‚úÖ Clear documentation of completion

**Conservative approach**: When in doubt, kept issues open.

## üöÄ Next Steps

### After Closure
1. Review the 10 issues needing investigation
2. Create follow-up issue for MicroVM integration verification
3. Update issue labels and milestones
4. Document final closure decisions

### Long Term
- Continue tracking 57 valid open issues
- Organize by priority and milestone
- Create project board for better visibility

## üìö Documentation

All analysis and evidence is documented in:
- `ISSUE_151_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` - Full analysis
- `MANUAL_CLOSURE_GUIDE.md` - Manual instructions
- `close_completed_issues.sh` - Automated script
