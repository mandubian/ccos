# Cargo.toml Binary Target Cleanup

## Analysis & Motivation

The original `Cargo.toml` had confusing and redundant binary target configurations that made it difficult to understand which binaries served what purpose. The issues included:

1. **Confusing naming**: Mixed underscores and hyphens, unclear purposes
2. **Outdated references**: Demo and test binaries that were development artifacts
3. **Inconsistent structure**: No clear organization or documentation
4. **Maintenance burden**: Multiple demo binaries that weren't part of core functionality

## Changes Made

### Before (Removed)
- `main_enhanced_tests` - Development test binary
- `summary_demo` - Demo development artifact  
- `repl_deployment_demo` - Demo development artifact

### After (Kept & Clarified)
- `rtfs-main` - Main compiler entry point (`src/main.rs`)
- `rtfs-cli` - Command line interface (`src/bin/rtfs_compiler.rs`)  
- `rtfs-repl` - Interactive REPL (`src/bin/rtfs_repl.rs`)

### Improvements
- **Clear naming**: All binaries use consistent hyphen-separated naming
- **Documentation**: Added descriptive comments explaining each binary's purpose
- **Clean structure**: Removed development artifacts and demo binaries
- **Consistent metadata**: Added `doc = false` to prevent documentation generation for binaries

## Verification

All core binaries were tested and build successfully:
- ✅ `cargo build --bin rtfs-main`
- ✅ `cargo build --bin rtfs-cli` 
- ✅ `cargo build --bin rtfs-repl`
- ✅ `cargo check` (overall project health)

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Each binary has a clear, descriptive name and purpose
2. **Maintainability**: Fewer binaries to track and maintain
3. **Consistency**: Uniform naming convention across all binaries
4. **Focus**: Only core functionality binaries remain
5. **Documentation**: Clear comments explain what each binary does

The cleaned up configuration makes it much easier for developers to understand the project structure and know which binary to use for different purposes.
