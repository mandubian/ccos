# RTFS 1.0 to CCOS: A Phased Migration Plan

**Date:** June 23, 2025
**Status:** In Progress

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the detailed, phased migration plan for evolving RTFS from its current state (version 1.0) into the Cognitive Computing Operating System (CCOS) as envisioned in `docs/vision/SENTIENT_RUNTIME_VISION.md`.

The core principles of this migration are:
- **Clean Slate Design:** We will design RTFS 2.0 optimally without legacy constraints, while reusing proven infrastructure from RTFS 1.0 (parser, AST, IR, REPL framework).
- **Phased Rollout:** The migration is broken down into distinct phases, allowing for incremental development, testing, and deployment.
- **Documentation First:** We will define and document the changes before implementing them in the codebase.
- **Infrastructure Reuse:** Leverage existing Rust compiler components to accelerate development.

## 2. Current State (RTFS 1.0)

- **Language:** A monolithic `Task` object. Homoiconic, LISP-like syntax.
- **Runtime:** A compiler and interpreter for RTFS code (`rtfs_compiler`).
- **Documentation:** Located in `docs/specs`, `docs/implementation`, etc.

## 3. Target State (CCOS / RTFS 2.0)

- **Language (RTFS 2.0):** A modular protocol with first-class objects: `Intent`, `Plan`, `Action`, `Capability`, `Resource`. Features a formal namespacing and versioning system.
- **Architecture (CCOS):** An LLM-based Arbiter for dynamic execution, a Living Intent Graph, a Generative Capability Marketplace, and a Causal Chain of Thought for auditing.
- **Documentation:** Reorganized into `docs/rtfs-1.0` (legacy), `docs/rtfs-2.0` (new spec), `docs/vision`, `docs/roadmap`, and `docs/migration`.

## 6. Risk Management & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **LLM Reliability**: AI decision-making may be unpredictable
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive prompt engineering, fallback to rule-based decisions
2. **Distributed Consensus**: Network partitions and byzantine failures
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple leader-election, evolve to full consensus
3. **Economic Attacks**: Marketplace manipulation, price wars
   - *Mitigation*: Rate limiting, reputation systems, circuit breakers
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Global AI systems face legal challenges
   - *Mitigation*: Data localization options, audit trails, kill switches

### Technical Debt Management
- **No RTFS 1.0 Legacy**: Clean slate allows optimal architecture decisions
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each phase adds one major concept
- **Testability First**: All components designed for isolated testing
- **Documentation Driven**: Specifications written before implementation

## 7. Infrastructure Assessment & Advantages

### Existing RTFS 1.0 Infrastructure Analysis

After analyzing `rtfs.pest`, we discovered the RTFS 1.0 infrastructure is much more sophisticated than initially assumed:

#### ✅ **Advanced Features Already Implemented**
- **Pest Grammar**: Professional-grade parsing with comprehensive syntax
- **Namespaced Identifiers**: `my.module/function` syntax already supported  
- **Rich Type System**: Complex type expressions, union types, function signatures
- **Task Definitions**: Structured object pattern with properties (perfect template)
- **Special Forms**: Comprehensive language constructs (let, fn, match, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch, validation, robust error reporting
- **REPL Integration**: Interactive development environment ready

#### 🚀 **Migration Acceleration Opportunities**
1. **Grammar Extension**: Build on existing `task_definition` pattern for 5 new objects
2. **Versioned Namespacing**: Extend existing `namespaced_identifier` with version component
3. **AST Infrastructure**: Rich AST system ready for new object types
4. **Parser Pipeline**: Pest → AST → IR pipeline can be reused directly
5. **REPL Framework**: Interactive tooling foundation already built

#### 📈 **Revised Effort Estimates**
- **Original Estimate**: 12 weeks for Phase 2A (language foundation)
- **Revised Estimate**: 8-10 weeks (30% reduction due to infrastructure reuse)
- **Risk Reduction**: Lower risk of parsing/grammar issues due to proven foundation

### Key Implementation Insights

1. **Pattern Replication**: Each RTFS 2.0 object follows same pattern as `task_definition`
2. **Incremental Testing**: Can test each object type independently using existing test framework  
3. **Backward Evolution**: Can keep RTFS 1.0 `task` alongside new objects during development
4. **REPL Integration**: Object inspection/creation commands will be straightforward to add
