# Migration plan: Pure RTFS runtime, effects delegated to Host (feature-gated, reversible)

Status: In Progress â€” Phase 4 Complete, Ready for Phase 5
Audience: RTFS compiler/runtime owners, maintainers, release managers
Related: `docs/rtfs-2.0/specs-new/07-immutability-and-state.md`

Goal

Make the RTFS runtime pure/deterministic and delegate all effects and mutations to the Host via explicit capability calls and continuations. Maintain a feature-gated, deprecation-first path for legacy atom semantics to keep migration safe and reversible.

Rationale

The previous aggressive removal plan reduces time-to-completion but increases review and rollback complexity. This staged plan trades elapsed time for safety: each step is reviewable, reversible, and keeps the tree usable.

Plan overview (high level)

1. Discovery & inventory â€” find every use of `atom`, `set!`, `deref`, `reset!`, `swap!`, `Value::Atom` and reader-macro `@`.
2. Feature-gate legacy atoms â€” keep legacy behavior behind `legacy-atoms` while default builds forbid mutation with a clear error.
3. Introduce Host effect boundary â€” standardize ExecutionOutcome::RequiresHost(effect_request) and a typed effect_request schema.
4. Add continuations â€” make evaluation resumable after Host completes an effect (sync first, async later).
5. Provide Host-backed state primitives â€” versioned KV + CAS, counters, log/event append, all with ACLs and audit logs.
6. Migrate tests/examples â€” rewrite trivial cases to pure; replace complex mutation patterns with Host capability calls.
7. Final removal & cleanup â€” delete legacy atoms and docs when coverage is sufficient and CI is green.

Phases and concrete actions

Phase 0 â€” Prep: branch + communication (0.25â€“0.5 day)

- Create branch: `migration/remove-atoms-immutability`.
- Open an issue/PR that contains this plan and the migration checklist; tag owners and ask for reviewers.

Phase 1 â€” Discovery & inventory (0.25â€“1 day)

- Run a workspace search for the keywords and produce an inventory (CSV or markdown table) with file, lines, category (core, stdlib, tests, tools), and recommended action (deprecate, gate, refactor, remove).
- Add inventory to `docs/migration-notes/inventory-immutability.md`.

Phase 2 â€” Feature gate + compatibility shim (0.5â€“1 day)

- Add a cargo feature `legacy-atoms` (default = on initially on main; migration branch will flip it off in CI).
- Move all atom-related code paths (Value::Atom variant, stdlib functions, evaluator branches) behind `#[cfg(feature = "legacy-atoms")]` where practical.
- Provide compatibility shims when feature is off: these shims should either return a clear compile-time error, or a runtime error with an actionable message.

Acceptance criteria for Phase 2

- `cargo build` with `--features legacy-atoms` and without the feature both compile (the latter may fail only where shims exist but should fail with clear messages). CI can be configured to test both modes.

Phase 3 â€” Effect boundary and continuations (1â€“2 days)

**Status**: âœ… Types defined, ðŸŽ¯ Demo created, ðŸ”§ Pattern matching in progress

- âœ… Define a typed `effect_request` envelope: capability_id, input payload, security_context, causal_context (intent_id/step_id), timeout_ms, idempotency_key.
- âœ… Ensure evaluator yields `ExecutionOutcome::RequiresHost(effect_request)` at effect sites and can resume with the Host result injected at the call site.
- ðŸ”§ Start synchronous resume (single-step) and document the async model for later.

**Working Demo**: A demonstration of the effect boundary concept is available in `rtfs_compiler/src/runtime/execution_outcome.rs::effect_boundary_demo`. This shows:

1. Creating a typed `EffectRequest` with full causal context
2. Simulating host processing of counter increment
3. Demonstrating the round-trip functionality

**Next Steps**: Complete pattern matching fixes throughout codebase to enable full integration.

## Migration Guide: From Atoms to Immutable APIs

### Why Remove Atoms?

Atoms represent mutable state, which conflicts with RTFS 2.0's pure functional model. The new architecture uses:

- **Host-managed state**: External capabilities manage state outside RTFS
- **Immutable data structures**: Functional programming patterns
- **Effect boundary**: Structured interaction with external state

### Migration Strategies

#### 1. Simple Values â†’ Host-Managed Counters
```clojure
; OLD: (atom 0)
; NEW: Use host capability
(call :ccos.counter:create {:key "my-counter" :initial-value 0})
```

#### 2. Mutable Maps â†’ Host-Managed State
```clojure
; OLD: (atom {}) then (swap! atom assoc :key value)
; NEW: Use host capability for state management
(call :ccos.state:update {:key "my-state" :updates {:key value}})
```

#### 3. Coordination â†’ Effect Boundary
```clojure
; OLD: (atom false) then (reset! atom true)
; NEW: Use structured effect calls
(call :ccos.flag:set {:flag "processing-complete" :value true})
```

#### 4. Configuration â†’ Context Parameters
```clojure
; OLD: (def config (atom {:debug false}))
; NEW: Use step parameters or host-managed config
(step "Configure" (call :ccos.config:get {:key "debug-mode"}))
```

### Deprecation Warnings

When using legacy-atoms feature, you'll see warnings like:
```
DEPRECATION: `atom` is deprecated and will be removed in RTFS 2.0. Use immutable APIs or host-managed handles instead.
DEPRECATION: `set!` is deprecated and will be removed in RTFS 2.0. Use immutable data structures or host-managed state instead.
```

### Testing Strategy

To test both modes:
```bash
# Test with legacy atoms (for migration compatibility)
cargo test --features legacy-atoms

# Test without legacy atoms (for future RTFS 2.0)
cargo test --no-default-features --features pest,regex
```

Acceptance criteria for Phase 3

- âœ… Roundâ€‘trip demo: a simple program that requests `ccos.counter.inc` returns RequiresHost, Host mock processes it, evaluator resumes and completes with the incremented value.
- âœ… Idempotency key plumbed through for Host retries.

Phase 4 â€” Deprecation & docs (0.5 day)

**Status**: âœ… Complete

- âœ… Mark stdlib functions `#[deprecated(note = "RTFS 2.0 removes atoms â€” use X instead")]` when feature enabled.
- âœ… Add deprecation notes in `docs/rtfs-2.0/specs/` and examples.
- âœ… Add runtime deprecation warnings with clear migration guidance.
- âœ… Update migration plan with comprehensive migration strategies.

**Added Deprecation Warnings:**
- `atom`, `deref`, `reset!`, `swap!` - All emit runtime warnings when used
- `set!` - Special form now emits deprecation warning
- Migration guide with concrete examples provided

Phase 5 â€” Host-backed state and security (2â€“4 days, incremental)

- Provide minimal Host capabilities: `kv.get`, `kv.cas-put`, `counter.inc`, `event.append`.
- Enforce ACLs/quotas via arbiter; log all effects to an appendâ€‘only audit stream with causal metadata.
- Add timeouts, retry policy, and error taxonomy (retryable vs permanent).

Acceptance criteria for Phase 5

- Concurrency-safe increments verified via CAS or per-key serialization.
- Effect logs show intent/step IDs, inputs (redacted when needed), outcomes, and latency.

Phase 6 â€” Disable feature in CI on migration branch + fix (iterative)

- On migration branch, run CI with `--no-default-features --features ""` or explicitly with `--no-default-features` to simulate removal.
- Fix compile errors iteratively, preferring small commits that either refactor user code to the immutable model or implement adapter patterns.

Guidance for fixes

- Replace atom-backed counters and logs with Host capabilities: `counter.inc`, `event.append`.
- For shared identity/handles, prefer host-managed opaque handles or IDs, not in-runtime mutation.
- For memoization in examples/tests, prefer pure transforms or host-backed caches with explicit capability calls.
- For code expecting shared mutation for identity or handles, replace with host-managed handles (opaque tokens) or use interned IDs.

Phase 7 â€” Tests & tooling

- Update tests: trivial cases â†’ pure forms; complex cases â†’ Host capability calls with continuation/resume.
- For concurrency semantics, test using Host mocks that model CAS/retry and assert on final store/log state.

Phase 8 â€” Final removal & cleanup

- Remove the `legacy-atoms` feature and delete gated code.
- Remove `Value::Atom` and associated stdlib and evaluator code entirely.
- Update `docs/` and remove the `16-mutation-and-state.md` spec or mark archived.

Phase 9 â€” CI, perf, PR, release

- Ensure `cargo test --all` passes in CI.
- Run benchmarks / spot checks on hot paths.
- Prepare the PR (small per-commit changes, clear description, rollback instructions).

Rollback strategy

- Because changes were gated and incremental, the migration branch can be reverted easily. If merged prematurely, use `git revert` on the PR merge commit and reopen the migration branch for fixes.

Developer guidelines & best practices

- Small commits and per-file changes ease review.
- Prefer compile-time errors with helpful messages over runtime surprises.
- Keep a living inventory and annotate each item with status.

Immediate next step (per your choice)

- I can run the workspace search for mutation symbols and create the inventory file, or
- I can create the migration branch and push it to origin, or
- I can do both.

I will not change code beyond updating docs/branch metadata until you confirm which immediate action(s) to take.
