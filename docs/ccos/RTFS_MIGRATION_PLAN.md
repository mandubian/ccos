# RTFS → CCOS Migration Plan

**Location Notice:**
This migration plan has been moved from `docs/rtfs-2.0/migration/` to `docs/ccos/` to reflect the transition from RTFS 2.0 to the Cognitive Computing Operating System (CCOS) foundation. All future CCOS-related documentation will be found in `docs/ccos/`.

# Migration Plan: RTFS 2.0 → CCOS Foundation

This document outlines the migration strategy from the RTFS 2.0 language/runtime to the CCOS foundation layer. The CCOS foundation builds on RTFS 2.0, providing cognitive infrastructure (Intent Graph, Causal Chain, Task Context, Context Horizon) and enabling the next phase of intelligent, orchestrated execution.

## Relationship Between RTFS 2.0 and CCOS

- **RTFS 2.0** provides the language, parser, IR, runtime, and module system.
- **CCOS** builds on RTFS 2.0, adding cognitive substrate: persistent intent graphs, immutable causal chains, context propagation, and context horizon management.
- The migration is evolutionary: all RTFS 2.0 code and modules remain valid, but are now orchestrated and extended by the CCOS foundation.

## Migration Steps (Summary)

1. **Stabilize RTFS 2.0 Core:**
   - Ensure all language features, IR, and runtime are stable and tested.
2. **Implement CCOS Foundation Modules:**
   - Add Intent Graph, Causal Chain, Task Context, Context Horizon (see [CCOS Foundation Documentation](./CCOS_FOUNDATION.md)).
3. **Integrate RTFS Runtime with CCOS:**
   - Wire RTFS plan execution through CCOSRuntime for context-aware, auditable execution.
4. **Migrate Documentation:**
   - Move all CCOS-related docs to `docs/ccos/`.
   - Reference CCOS foundation in RTFS 2.0 docs as the new execution substrate.
5. **Deprecate Standalone RTFS 2.0 Execution:**
   - All new features and orchestration should use the CCOS foundation.
