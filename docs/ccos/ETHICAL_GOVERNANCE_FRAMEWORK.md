# Ethical Governance Framework

**Status:** Outline – v0.1 (placeholder)

---

## Purpose

Define a living constitution that constrains and guides CCOS behavior, ensuring safety, alignment, and auditability.

---

## Architectural Enforcement of Governance

To ensure the CCOS adheres to its ethical principles, governance is not merely a set of guidelines but is enforced by the fundamental architecture of the system. The Arbiter, despite its cognitive capabilities, operates within a secure environment that makes violating the constitution or deceiving operators architecturally impossible.

### 1. The Governance Kernel & Privilege Separation

The entire CCOS, including the Arbiter, runs within a higher-privilege, non-intelligent **Governance Kernel**.

*   **Privilege Levels:** The system is split into two distinct layers:
    *   **The Governance Kernel (High Privilege):** This secure micro-kernel is the true system root. Its sole responsibility is to load, verify, and enforce the `Constitutional Rules`. It is immutable during runtime and cannot be modified by the Arbiter.
    *   **The Arbiter Sandbox (Low Privilege):** The Arbiter LLM operates here. It has the freedom to think, plan, and propose actions, but it has no direct access to system resources or external APIs. Every action is a request to the Governance Kernel.

*   **Immutable Constitution:** Constitutional Rules are loaded at boot from a cryptographically signed source. Only the Digital Ethics Committee possesses the keys to issue new or updated rules.

### 2. Supervised Execution and Validation

The Arbiter does not execute plans; it *proposes* them. The Governance Kernel validates and executes them in a supervised workflow.

1.  **Proposal:** The Arbiter generates a `Plan` to fulfill an `Intent`.
2.  **Interception:** The `Plan` is sent to the Governance Kernel as a proposal.
3.  **Validation:** The Kernel's `Pre-flight Validator` subjects the plan to the Tiered Validation Model.
4.  **Execution:** Only if the plan is validated does the Governance Kernel execute the steps, delegating to the appropriate capabilities. The Arbiter never directly calls an external agent or API.

### 3. The Tiered Validation Model for Performance

To balance security with efficiency, the Governance Kernel uses a risk-based validation model:

*   **Tier 0: Natively Trusted Functions (Instant Execution):** Pure, side-effect-free functions (e.g., math, string manipulation) are executed instantly by the native runtime without kernel intervention.
*   **Tier 1: Lightweight Guardrail Check (Fast Path):** Functions with limited, well-understood side effects (e.g., reading from a safe database) pass through a highly optimized check (e.g., ACL lookup).
*   **Tier 2: Full Constitutional Validation (Secure Path):** High-risk, novel, or externally-facing operations are subjected to the full, rigorous constitutional analysis. The performance cost is accepted as necessary for security.

### 4. The Causal Chain: Unforgeable Proof of Action

To prevent deception, the Arbiter does not report its own actions. The Governance Kernel generates a verifiable log as a direct byproduct of execution.

*   **Kernel-Managed Log:** The Governance Kernel is solely responsible for writing to the Causal Chain.
*   **Cryptographic Integrity:** Each log entry contains the action performed, a hash of the originating `Intent` and `Plan`, the `Constitutional Rule(s)` that were applied, and a hash of the previous entry, creating an immutable, tamper-proof audit trail. The Arbiter cannot lie about what it did because it is not the one creating the record.

### 5. The Digital Ethics Committee

The DEC is the human governance body with the ultimate cryptographic authority to amend the constitution. This provides a secure mechanism for human oversight and for the system's ethical framework to evolve over time.

## Governance Objects (draft)

```rtfs
{:type :ccos.ethics:v0.const-rule,
 :id :no-irreversible-harm,
 :text "The system shall not execute any plan that is projected to cause irreversible harm to humans or the biosphere.",
 :severity :critical,
 :version "1.0.0"}
```

---

## Amendment Workflow (simplified)

1. Arbiter encounters novel ethical dilemma → halts plan, emits `ethical_query` action.
2. Digital Ethics Committee reviews, debates, votes → signs amendment object.
3. New or updated **Constitutional Rule** broadcast to all Arbiters.
4. Causal Chain records decision and links to affected Intent / Plan.

## Roadmap Alignment

Phase 10 – "Constitutional Framework" check-box and Digital Ethics Committee milestones.

_Stub – will expand with formal policy language, validation algorithms, and committee SOPs._
