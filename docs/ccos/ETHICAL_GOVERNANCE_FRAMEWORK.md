# Ethical Governance Framework

**Status:** Outline – v0.1 (placeholder)

---

## Purpose

Define a living constitution that constrains and guides CCOS behavior, ensuring safety, alignment, and auditability.

---

## Core Layers

1. **Constitutional Rules** – Hard, non-overridable RTFS rules ("Do no harm", "Respect privacy").
2. **Pre-flight Validator** – Static analysis & simulation before plan execution.
3. **Runtime Guardrails** – Real-time enforcement during execution/delegation.
4. **Digital Ethics Committee** – Human governance body with cryptographic keys to amend rules.

---

## Governance Objects (draft)

```rtfs
{:type :ccos.ethics:v0.const-rule,
 :id :no-irreversible-harm,
 :text "The system shall not execute any plan that is projected to cause irreversible harm to humans or the biosphere.",
 :severity :critical,
 :version "1.0.0"}
```

---

## Amendment Workflow (simplified)

1. Arbiter encounters novel ethical dilemma → halts plan, emits `ethical_query` action.
2. Digital Ethics Committee reviews, debates, votes → signs amendment object.
3. New or updated **Constitutional Rule** broadcast to all Arbiters.
4. Causal Chain records decision and links to affected Intent / Plan.

## Roadmap Alignment

Phase 10 – "Constitutional Framework" check-box and Digital Ethics Committee milestones.

_Stub – will expand with formal policy language, validation algorithms, and committee SOPs._
