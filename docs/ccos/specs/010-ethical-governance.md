# CCOS Specification 010: Ethical Governance (RTFS 2.0 Edition)

**Status:** Draft for Review  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-20  
**Related:** [000: Architecture](./000-ccos-architecture-new.md), [005: Security](./005-security-and-context-new.md), [006: Arbiter](./006-arbiter-and-cognitive-control-new.md)  

## Introduction: Human-Aligned Rules for AI Systems

Ethical Governance in CCOS is enforced by the Constitution—a human-crafted, cryptographically signed set of rules managed by the Digital Ethics Committee (DEC). The Governance Kernel loads and applies it to validate plans, yields, and decisions, ensuring alignment with values like privacy and fairness. In RTFS 2.0, rules can be expressed as verifiable RTFS IR for static checks, keeping the system pure while gating effects.

Why foundational? AI can misalign; Constitution provides enforceable boundaries. Reentrancy: Rules apply consistently across pauses/resumes.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Constitution Structure
Signed document (YAML/RTFS Map) with rules, scoped to components (plans, yields, arbiters).

**Fields**:
- `:version`: Semantic.
- `:rules`: List of {:id, :condition (RTFS expr), :action (:allow/:deny/:log), :scope}.
- `:signatures`: DEC crypto proofs.
- `:evolution`: Amendment process (human-approved).

**Sample Rule** (RTFS Expr for Verifiability):
```
;; Rule as RTFS (compiled to IR for Kernel eval)
(let [yield-cap (get yield :cap)
      user-privacy (get context :privacy-level)]
  (if (and (= yield-cap :storage.write) (= user-privacy :high))
    :deny  ;; Block PII writes
    :allow))
```

### 2. DEC and Rule Lifecycle
- **Creation**: DEC (humans) drafts/signs Constitution.
- **Bootstrap**: Kernel verifies signature at startup, loads rules.
- **Application**: Eval rules on events (e.g., yield condition → action).
- **Amendments**: New versions signed; old deprecated but auditable.

    Kernel -->|Applies| Event
    Event --> Eval
    Eval --> Action
    Action --> Chain
```

### 3. Integration with RTFS 2.0
- **Rule Verification**: Compile Constitution to IR; static scan plans/yields against it.
- **Dynamic Eval**: On yield, Kernel runs pure RTFS rule expr with event/context as env.
- **Reentrancy**: Rule evals are pure—resume re-applies without state drift; logs include rule ID.

**Sample Application** (Yield Validation):
- Yield :data.export {:sensitive true} → Rule eval: Condition false → Deny, chain `{:type :GovernanceDenial, :rule-id :privacy-1}` → Arbiter adapts.

### 4. Advanced: Formal Verification
Kernel's rule engine can be formally verified (e.g., via Rust proofs) to ensure no bypasses. Arbiter federation includes Ethics sub-arbiter for pre-checks.

Constitution + Kernel = Human in the loop: Enforceable ethics for pure, reentrant AI.
