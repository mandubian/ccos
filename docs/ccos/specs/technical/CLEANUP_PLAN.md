# Technical Directory Cleanup Plan

**Date:** July 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Purpose:** Consolidate and clean up technical documentation

## Overview

The technical directory contains valuable implementation details that complement the RTFS 2.0 specifications. This plan outlines what should be kept, merged, or removed to avoid duplication and maintain consistency.

## Files to Keep and Merge

### ✅ **CAPABILITY_SYSTEM_SPEC.md** - KEEP
- **Status**: Merged into `docs/rtfs-2.0/specs/12-capability-system-implementation.md`
- **Action**: ✅ COMPLETED - Content has been integrated into RTFS 2.0 specs
- **Reason**: Contains detailed implementation architecture that complements the formal specs

### ✅ **RTFS_CCOS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - KEEP  
- **Status**: Merged into `docs/rtfs-2.0/specs/13-rtfs-ccos-integration-guide.md`
- **Action**: ✅ COMPLETED - Content has been integrated into RTFS 2.0 specs
- **Reason**: Provides clear distinction between RTFS and CCOS runtime

### ✅ **01-core-objects.md** - KEEP
- **Status**: Grammar corrected in RTFS 2.0 specs
- **Action**: ✅ COMPLETED - Correct grammar has been applied to philosophy and object schemas
- **Reason**: Contains the correct RTFS 2.0 object grammar that was missing from specs

### ✅ **03-object-schemas.md** - KEEP
- **Status**: Content complements RTFS 2.0 object schemas
- **Action**: ✅ COMPLETED - RTFS 2.0 object schemas updated with correct grammar
- **Reason**: Contains detailed JSON schemas that complement the formal specs

## Files to Remove (Duplicate or Outdated)

### ❌ **MICROVM_ARCHITECTURE.md** - REMOVE
- **Status**: Outdated
- **Action**: Delete file
- **Reason**: Content is outdated and not relevant to current RTFS 2.0 architecture

### ❌ **RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_INTEGRATION.md** - REMOVE
- **Status**: Duplicate content
- **Action**: Delete file  
- **Reason**: Content covered in RTFS 2.0 integration guide

### ❌ **04-serialization.md** - REMOVE
- **Status**: Covered in RTFS 2.0 specs
- **Action**: Delete file
- **Reason**: Serialization details covered in formal language specification

### ❌ **05-object-builders.md** - REMOVE
- **Status**: Implementation detail
- **Action**: Delete file
- **Reason**: Implementation details should be in code, not specs

### ❌ **06-standard-library.md** - REMOVE
- **Status**: Covered in formal language specification
- **Action**: Delete file
- **Reason**: Standard library details covered in `10-formal-language-specification.md`

## Files to Review

### ⚠️ **TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - REVIEW
- **Status**: Contains valuable implementation details
- **Action**: Review and extract unique content
- **Reason**: May contain implementation details not covered in RTFS 2.0 specs

### ⚠️ **README.md** - UPDATE
- **Status**: Needs updating
- **Action**: Update to reflect current state
- **Reason**: References outdated files and status

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Remove Outdated Files
```bash
# Remove outdated files
rm docs/ccos/specs/technical/MICROVM_ARCHITECTURE.md
rm docs/ccos/specs/technical/RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE_INTEGRATION.md
rm docs/ccos/specs/technical/04-serialization.md
rm docs/ccos/specs/technical/05-object-builders.md
rm docs/ccos/specs/technical/06-standard-library.md
```

### Phase 2: Review Remaining Files
```bash
# Review technical implementation guide
# Extract any unique content not covered in RTFS 2.0 specs
```

### Phase 3: Update README
```bash
# Update technical README to reflect current state
# Remove references to deleted files
# Update status information
```

## Final State

After cleanup, the technical directory should contain:

### Core Files (Keep)
- `README.md` - Updated with current status
- `01-core-objects.md` - Reference for correct grammar
- `03-object-schemas.md` - JSON schema definitions
- `CAPABILITY_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` - Implementation reference
- `RTFS_CCOS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Integration reference
- `TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation details (if unique content exists)

### RTFS 2.0 Integration
- All formal specifications moved to `docs/rtfs-2.0/specs/`
- Technical implementation details integrated where appropriate
- No duplication between technical and formal specs

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Duplication**: No more conflicting grammar or specifications
2. **Clear Separation**: Formal specs vs implementation details
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for each specification
4. **Consistency**: All RTFS 2.0 specs use the same grammar and approach
5. **Completeness**: Technical details complement formal specifications

## Notes

- The RTFS 2.0 specs now contain the correct grammar from `01-core-objects.md`
- Implementation details are properly integrated into the formal specs
- Technical directory serves as a reference for implementation details
- No loss of valuable content during consolidation
