# MicroVM Architecture for RTFS/CCOS

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a lightweight, pluggable MicroVM architecture for the RTFS/CCOS system that provides secure isolation for dangerous operations without making the system bloated.

## Key Features

### 1. Pluggable Architecture
- **MicroVM Provider Interface**: Clean abstraction (`MicroVMProvider` trait) that allows different isolation technologies
- **Multiple Backends**: Support for mock, process, Firecracker, gVisor, and WASM providers
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic provider registration and discovery
- **Runtime Selection**: Ability to switch between providers at runtime

### 2. Security Isolation
- **Capability-Based Security**: Only specific capabilities (network, file I/O) require MicroVM isolation
- **Granular Policies**: Different security policies for different capability types
- **Resource Limits**: Memory, CPU, and timeout constraints per capability
- **Network Policies**: Allow/deny lists for network access
- **Filesystem Policies**: Sandboxed filesystem access with read/write permissions

### 3. Configuration-Driven
- **TOML Configuration**: Human-readable configuration files
- **Environment-Specific Settings**: Different configs for dev, test, and production
- **Capability-Specific Policies**: Fine-grained configuration per capability
- **Runtime Overrides**: Ability to modify settings at runtime

### 4. Non-Bloated Integration
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential libraries (serde, toml, uuid)
- **Lazy Loading**: Providers are only loaded when needed
- **Clean Separation**: Clear boundary between runtime and isolation layer
- **Optional Features**: Platform-specific providers are feature-gated

## Architecture Components

### Core Components

1. **MicroVMProvider Trait**
   - Defines the interface for isolation providers
   - Provides lifecycle management (initialize, execute, cleanup)
   - Returns execution metadata (duration, memory usage, network requests)

2. **MicroVMFactory**
   - Manages provider registration and discovery
   - Handles provider initialization
   - Provides available provider detection

3. **ExecutionContext**
   - Encapsulates capability execution parameters
   - Includes security configuration
   - Provides execution isolation boundary

4. **MicroVMConfig**
   - Defines resource limits and policies
   - Configurable per capability type
   - Supports environment-specific settings

### Provider Implementations

1. **MockMicroVMProvider**
   - Always available for development/testing
   - Simulates isolation behavior
   - Returns realistic mock responses

2. **ProcessMicroVMProvider**
   - Uses OS processes for isolation
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Suitable for basic sandboxing

3. **FirecrackerMicroVMProvider** (Linux only)
   - Uses Firecracker microVMs
   - Strong isolation guarantees
   - Suitable for production workloads

4. **GvisorMicroVMProvider** (Linux only)
   - Uses gVisor application kernel
   - Container-based isolation
   - Good performance characteristics

5. **WasmMicroVMProvider** (Feature-gated)
   - WebAssembly-based isolation
   - Portable across platforms
   - Limited but secure execution environment

## Integration Points

### Capability Registry Integration
- **Automatic Detection**: Capabilities requiring MicroVM isolation are automatically detected
- **Transparent Execution**: Existing capability calls work without modification
- **Fallback Handling**: Safe capabilities execute normally without isolation overhead

### Configuration Management
- **Default Settings**: Sensible defaults for all providers
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic environment-specific configuration
- **Override Capabilities**: Runtime configuration changes supported

### Security Policies
- **Network Isolation**: Configurable network access policies
- **Filesystem Sandboxing**: Restricted filesystem access
- **Resource Limits**: Memory, CPU, and time constraints
- **Audit Trail**: Execution metadata for security monitoring

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```rust
let mut registry = CapabilityRegistry::new();
registry.set_microvm_provider("mock")?;

// This will execute in a MicroVM automatically
let result = registry.execute_capability_with_microvm(
    "ccos.network.http-fetch", 
    vec![Value::String("https://api.example.com".to_string())]
)?;
```

### Configuration
```toml
# microvm.toml
default_provider = "mock"

[capability_configs."ccos.network.http-fetch"]
timeout = "30s"
memory_limit_mb = 64
cpu_limit = 0.3
network_policy = { AllowList = ["api.github.com", "httpbin.org"] }
fs_policy = "None"
```

### Custom Provider
```rust
impl MicroVMProvider for CustomProvider {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str { "custom" }
    fn is_available(&self) -> bool { true }
    fn initialize(&mut self) -> RuntimeResult<()> { /* ... */ }
    fn execute(&self, context: ExecutionContext) -> RuntimeResult<ExecutionResult> { /* ... */ }
    fn cleanup(&mut self) -> RuntimeResult<()> { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Benefits

### Security
- **Isolation**: Dangerous operations are isolated from the main runtime
- **Least Privilege**: Each capability runs with minimal necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (network, filesystem, resources)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of isolated operations

### Performance
- **Selective Isolation**: Only dangerous operations incur isolation overhead
- **Lazy Loading**: Providers are only initialized when needed
- **Efficient Execution**: Mock provider for development, optimized providers for production
- **Resource Management**: Configurable resource limits prevent resource exhaustion

### Maintainability
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new providers
- **Testable**: Mock provider enables comprehensive testing
- **Configurable**: Behavior can be adjusted without code changes

### Deployment Flexibility
- **Environment-Specific**: Different providers for different environments
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Core architecture works across platforms
- **Gradual Rollout**: Can start with mock/process providers and upgrade to stronger isolation
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Remote MicroVM Support**: Execute capabilities on remote secure enclaves
2. **Container Integration**: Native Docker/Podman support
3. **Hardware Security**: TPM and SGX integration
4. **Advanced Monitoring**: Real-time security metrics and alerting
5. **Policy Engine**: Dynamic policy generation based on threat assessment

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Provider Pooling**: Pre-warmed MicroVM instances for faster execution
2. **Caching**: Result caching for idempotent operations
3. **Batching**: Multiple capability executions in a single MicroVM
4. **Streaming**: Support for long-running streaming operations

## Conclusion

The MicroVM architecture provides a robust, flexible, and lightweight solution for secure capability execution in RTFS/CCOS. It maintains the system's core principle of being non-bloated while providing enterprise-grade security isolation. The pluggable design ensures that the system can evolve with changing security requirements and technology advances.
