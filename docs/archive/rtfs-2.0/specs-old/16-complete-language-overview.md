# RTFS 2.0: Complete Language Features Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all RTFS 2.0 language features, organized by category. RTFS is a pure functional, homoiconic language designed for safe, verifiable computation within the CCOS (Cognitive-Causal Orchestration System) framework.

## 1. Core Language Constructs

### Data Types and Literals
- **Atoms**: Integers, strings, symbols, keywords, booleans, nil
- **Collections**: Lists `()`, vectors `[]`, maps `{}`
- **Functions**: First-class functions with lexical scoping

### Special Forms
- **Definition**: `def`, `defn` - bind values and functions to symbols
- **Control Flow**: `if`, `cond` - conditional execution
- **Binding**: `let` - lexical variable binding with destructuring
- **Functions**: `fn`, `lambda` - function definition and anonymous functions

## 2. Advanced Pattern Matching and Destructuring

RTFS supports sophisticated pattern matching through destructuring, allowing direct binding of nested data structures.

### Vector Destructuring
```rtfs
;; Basic vector destructuring
(let [[a b c] [1 2 3]]
  (+ a b c))  ; => 6

;; Nested destructuring with rest
(let [[head & tail] [1 2 3 4]]
  [head (count tail)])  ; => [1 3]

;; Function parameters with destructuring
(defn add-coords [[x y]]
  (+ x y))
```

### Map Destructuring
```rtfs
;; Keyword key destructuring
(let [{:keys [name age]} {:name "Alice" :age 30}]
  (str name " is " age))  ; => "Alice is 30"

;; Explicit key binding
(let [{:name n :age a} {:name "Bob" :age 25}]
  [n a])  ; => ["Bob" 25]

;; Mixed destructuring with :as
(let [{:keys [x y] :as point} {:x 10 :y 20 :z 30}]
  [x y point])  ; => [10 20 {:x 10 :y 20 :z 30}]
```

### Wildcard Patterns
```rtfs
;; Ignore values with underscore
(let [[_ important _] [1 42 3]]
  important)  ; => 42
```

## 3. Continuation-Passing and Host Boundary

RTFS implements a unique continuation model where all external effects are mediated through the host environment.

### Host Calls and Continuations
```rtfs
;; Basic host capability call
(call :fs.read "/path/to/file")

;; Continuation with callback
(call :async.compute
  (fn [result] (println "Result:" result)))
```

### Execution Model
- Pure RTFS evaluation produces either a final value or `ExecutionOutcome::RequiresHost`
- Host processes the request and resumes execution with the result
- This creates a secure boundary where RTFS cannot perform side effects directly

### Streaming Capabilities
RTFS supports incremental data processing through host-mediated streaming:

```rtfs
;; Stream processing via host capabilities
(call :stream.process
  {:source :file-stream
   :processor (fn [chunk] (transform chunk))
   :on-complete (fn [result] (finalize result))})
```

## 4. Macro System

RTFS provides compile-time code transformation through hygienic macros.

### Macro Definition
```rtfs
;; Simple macro example
(defmacro unless (condition then-expr)
  `(if (not ,condition) ,then-expr nil))

;; Usage
(unless (= 2 2) (call :fs.delete "/"))  ; Safe - condition prevents execution
```

### Key Macro Features
- **Quasiquote**: ``` ` ``` for code templates
- **Unquote**: `,` for value insertion
- **Unquote-splicing**: `,@` for list splicing
- Compile-time evaluation prevents runtime side effects

## 5. Module and Namespace System

RTFS supports modular code organization with explicit imports and exports.

### Module Definition
```rtfs
;; Module declaration
(module my-module
  (export add multiply)
  (import [math :as m])

  (defn add [a b] (m/+ a b))
  (defn multiply [a b] (m/* a b)))
```

### Import/Export
- Explicit export lists for encapsulation
- Qualified and aliased imports
- Namespace isolation prevents name conflicts

## 6. Type System and Validation

RTFS includes a structural type system for runtime safety.

### Type Annotations
```rtfs
;; Function type annotation
(defn add {:type {:args [Integer Integer] :return Integer}}
  [a b]
  (+ a b))
```

### Runtime Type Checking
- Optional type validation during execution
- Structural typing for maps and collections
- Type-driven dispatch capabilities

## 7. Concurrency and Parallel Processing

RTFS supports structured concurrency through host-mediated parallelism.

### Parallel Execution
```rtfs
;; Parallel processing
(call :parallel.map
  (fn [item] (expensive-computation item))
  [1 2 3 4 5])
```

### Coordination Primitives
- Host-managed thread pools
- Structured concurrency with cancellation
- Deterministic execution ordering

## 8. Error Handling and Recovery

RTFS provides comprehensive error handling with structured error types.

### Error Types
- **RuntimeError**: Evaluation errors, type mismatches
- **HostError**: Capability execution failures
- **ValidationError**: Type and constraint violations

### Error Handling
```rtfs
;; Try-catch style error handling
(try
  (risky-operation)
  (catch RuntimeError e
    (handle-error e)))
```

## 9. Security Model

RTFS enforces security through the host boundary and capability system.

### Capability-Based Security
- All external operations require explicit host capabilities
- Fine-grained permission system
- Audit trail of all side effects

### Sandboxing
- Pure functional core prevents direct system access
- Host-mediated I/O operations
- Memory and execution limits enforced by host

## 10. Performance and Optimization

RTFS includes several performance optimization features.

### Compilation Optimizations
- **IR (Intermediate Representation)**: Efficient bytecode compilation
- **Inlining**: Automatic function inlining for performance
- **Constant Folding**: Compile-time evaluation of constant expressions

### Memory Management
- Immutable data structures reduce copying overhead
- Lazy evaluation for large data structures
- Host-managed resource pooling

## 11. Interoperability Features

RTFS is designed for seamless integration with host systems.

### Foreign Function Interface
```rtfs
;; Call host functions
(call :host.invoke
  {:module "math"
   :function "sqrt"
   :args [16.0]})
```

### Data Format Conversion
- Automatic JSON/RTFS conversion
- Protocol buffer integration
- Custom serialization formats

## 12. Development and Debugging Tools

RTFS provides comprehensive tooling for development.

### REPL and Interactive Development
- Interactive evaluation environment
- Incremental compilation
- Hot reloading capabilities

### Debugging Support
- Source map generation
- Stack trace correlation
- Performance profiling hooks

## 13. Advanced Language Features

### Quoting and Metaprogramming
```rtfs
;; Code as data
(def code '(+ 1 2 3))
(eval code)  ; => 6

;; Macro expansion inspection
(macroexpand '(unless true (println "hello")))
; => (if (not true) (println "hello") nil)
```

### Lazy Evaluation
```rtfs
;; Lazy sequences
(def lazy-numbers
  (lazy-seq (range 1 1000000)))

;; Only computed when needed
(take 10 lazy-numbers)
```

## Summary

RTFS 2.0 combines the elegance of Lisp with modern language features, all while maintaining strict purity and security through the host boundary. The language provides:

- **Safety**: Host-mediated effects prevent direct system access
- **Expressiveness**: Macros, destructuring, and advanced patterns
- **Performance**: Optimized compilation and execution
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with host environments
- **Verifiability**: Pure functional core enables formal verification

This comprehensive feature set makes RTFS suitable for complex AI agent coordination, secure computation, and verifiable system integration within the CCOS framework.
