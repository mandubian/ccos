# Arbiter Federation

**Status:** Outline – v0.1 (placeholder)

---

## Purpose

Describe the architecture where multiple specialized Arbiters (Logic, Creativity, Strategy, Ethics, etc.) collaborate to orchestrate execution, providing diversity of thought, robustness, and built-in checks & balances.

---

## Federation Roles (examples)

| Arbiter                | Core Focus                                       | Example Decision                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logic Arbiter**      | Deterministic reasoning, constraint satisfaction | Choose optimal algorithm for numeric optimization.      |
| **Creativity Arbiter** | Brainstorming, generative synthesis              | Propose alternative UI copy or design variations.       |
| **Strategy Arbiter**   | Long-term planning, trade-off analysis           | Select multi-step plan to achieve quarterly OKRs.       |
| **Ethics Arbiter**     | Policy compliance, risk assessment               | Block plan that conflicts with `:no-irreversible-harm`. |

---

## Collaboration Workflow (simplified)

1. **Issue** – Primary Arbiter receives Intent & Plan draft.
2. **Debate** – Relevant Arbiters simulate, critique, and suggest alternatives.
3. **Vote** – Federation reaches consensus (e.g., majority or weighted scoring).
4. **Record** – Dissenting opinions & final decision recorded in Causal Chain.

---

## Communication Protocol

All inter-arbiter messages are RTFS objects with type `:ccos.fed:v0.debate-msg` containing proposal, critique, vote, and signature fields.

---

## Roadmap Alignment

- Phase 10: "Federation of Minds" checklist items (specialized arbiters, meta-arbiter routing, inter-arbiter communication)
- Phase 11: Integration with Living Intent Graph & Ethical Governance Framework.

_Stub – future work will define consensus algorithms, failure modes, and performance considerations._
