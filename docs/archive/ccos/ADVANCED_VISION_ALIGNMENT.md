## 1. How to use this document

1. SRV concepts listed in the left column.
2. **Current Coverage** shows whether the idea already has documentation or code.
3. **Next Step / Owner** points to the document or roadmap phase that will expand the concept.
4. ✅ = sufficiently covered 🔄 = partially covered (needs depth) ❌ = missing.
