# CCOS Foundation Migration & Completion Tracker

This document is the single source of truth for tracking the migration and completion of the Cognitive Computing Operating System (CCOS) foundation. It is organized by architectural layer, priority, and logical development flow. Use this as a living roadmap for the team.

---

## 0. Meta: Project Hygiene
- [ ] Establish a single source of truth for progress tracking (this file)
- [ ] Adopt a clear labeling system for issues/PRs: `[ccos-core]`, `[arbiter]`, `[capability]`, etc.
- [ ] Automate test and linting pipelines for all new features

---

## 1. Core Data & State Layer

### 1.1. Intent Graph
- [ ] Implement persistent storage for intents (database or file-backed, with in-memory fallback)
- [ ] Support parent-child and arbitrary relationships (edges, types, weights)
- [ ] Lifecycle management: active, completed, archived, failed, suspended
- [ ] Graph querying and visualization API (for UI and debugging)
- [ ] Intent virtualization for large graphs (summarization, pruning, search)

### 1.2. Causal Chain
- [x] Action object creation and immutable ledger append (basic complete)
- [x] Cryptographic signing of actions (basic complete)
- [x] Performance metrics and provenance tracking (basic complete)
- [ ] Causal Chain distillation and summarization (for working memory/context horizon)
- [ ] Efficient querying and filtering (by intent, plan, time, type, etc.)

### 1.3. Plan Archive
- [ ] Content-addressable, immutable storage for all plans
- [ ] Archival and retrieval API (by hash, plan_id, or intent)
- [ ] Plan versioning and deduplication

### 1.4. Task Context System
- [ ] Implement `@context-key` access in runtime and plans
- [ ] Context propagation across actions and plan steps
- [ ] Context persistence and retrieval (per intent, per plan, per session)

### 1.5. Working Memory
- [ ] Index and summarize causal chain for fast, queryable recall
- [ ] Expose query API for Arbiter and Context Horizon
- [ ] Support for semantic and time-based queries

## 2. Orchestration Layer

### 2.1. Orchestrator
- [x] Plan execution with step tracking (basic complete)

- [ ] Module loading and dependency resolution (for plan steps)

### 2.2. Delegation Engine
- [x] Skeleton and static delegation (complete)
- [ ] Policy-driven, context-aware routing (privacy, cost, latency, fallback)
- [ ] Integration with Global Function Mesh (GFM) for provider discovery
- [ ] Decision caching and L4 content-addressable cache integration

### 2.3. Capability System
- [x] Local and HTTP capabilities (complete)
- [ ] Implement advanced provider types:
  - [ ] MCP (Model Context Protocol) client/server
  - [ ] A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication
  - [ ] Plugin system (dynamic loading)
  - [ ] RemoteRTFS execution
  - [ ] Stream capabilities (full streaming support)
- [ ] Dynamic capability discovery (registry, network, plugin, agent-based)
- [ ] Input/output schema validation for all capabilities
- [ ] Capability attestation and provenance (see Security)

### 2.4. Context Horizon
- [ ] Token estimation and truncation for LLM context
- [ ] Summarization and filtering (AI-based, rule-based)
- [ ] Integration with Working Memory for context payloads
- [ ] Boundary management (token, time, memory, semantic)

## 3. Cognitive Layer

### 3.1. Arbiter (V1: Proto-Arbiter)
- [ ] LLM execution bridge (`(llm-execute)`)
- [ ] Natural language to intent/plan conversion (LLM + templates)
- [ ] Dynamic capability resolution via marketplace
- [ ] Agent registry integration (for delegation)
- [ ] Task delegation and RTFS Task Protocol

### 3.2. Arbiter (V2: Intent-Aware Arbiter)
- [ ] Intent-based provider selection (economic, policy, preference)
- [ ] Global Function Mesh (GFM) V1 (discovery, routing)
- [ ] Language of Intent (intent meta-reasoning, negotiation)

### 3.3. Arbiter Federation
- [ ] Specialized Arbiter roles (Logic, Creativity, Strategy, Ethics)
- [ ] Multi-Arbiter consensus protocols (voting, quorum, dissent)
- [ ] Inter-Arbiter communication (RTFS-based protocol)

## 4. Security, Governance, and Ethics

### 4.1. Governance Kernel
- [x] Plan validation and scaffolding (basic complete)
- [ ] Constitution loading from signed file (root of trust)

- [ ] Attestation verification for all capabilities (cryptographic signature check)
- [ ] Logging of all rule checks and violations

### 4.2. Ethical Governance Framework
- [ ] Digital Ethics Committee (multi-signature approval, amendment process)
- [ ] Policy compliance system (real-time checks, risk assessment)
- [ ] Audit trail for ethical decisions

### 4.3. Capability Attestation & Provenance
- [ ] Attestation verification in Governance Kernel
- [ ] Provenance tracking for all capability executions (publisher, attestation, hash, etc.)
- [ ] Quarantine/reject unverified capabilities
