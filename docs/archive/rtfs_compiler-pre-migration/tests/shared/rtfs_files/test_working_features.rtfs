; RTFS Working Features Test
; Focus on features that should definitely work based on IR implementation

; Test basic arithmetic operations
(+ 1 2 3)

; Test subtraction
(- 10 3)

; Test multiplication
(* 6 7)

; Test nested arithmetic
(+ (* 2 3) (- 8 2))

; Test let binding with arithmetic
(let [x 5] (* x x))

; Test nested let
(let [x 10]
  (let [y 20]
    (+ x y)))

; Test basic function definition and call (if supported)
;; (defn square [n] (* n n))
;; (square 4)

; Test conditional (if supported)  
;; (if true 42 0)

; Focus on what we know works from successful tests
