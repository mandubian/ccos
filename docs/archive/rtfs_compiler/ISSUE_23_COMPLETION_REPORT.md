# Issue #23 Progress Report: Arbiter V1 — LLM execution bridge and NL→Intent/Plan

- Issue: #23 — [CCOS] Arbiter V1: LLM execution bridge and NL-to-intent/plan conversion
- Status: Complete (M1–M5 delivered; follow-ups queued)
- Report Date: August 13, 2025

## Executive Summary

Arbiter V1 is feature-complete. The system provides a baseline (template) Arbiter and a DelegatingArbiter (LLM / agent hybrid) behind environment toggles. Natural language inputs become structured Intents and executable RTFS Plans (scaffolded with `(step ...)` and capability calls). A governance + marketplace pipeline performs preflight capability validation, sanitation, scaffolding, constitutional validation, and orchestrated execution with full causal chain audit. Delegation lifecycle now records proposed → approved → (optional rejected) → completed events, and agent performance feedback updates success statistics. A Task Protocol bootstrap (TaskRequest / TaskResult structs) is in place to extend into richer task delegation in subsequent iterations.

## Recent Changes (Aug 11–13, 2025)

- Added Delegation completion event and feedback loop (`record_feedback`) updating rolling agent success rates.
- Emitted full delegation lifecycle events (proposed/approved/rejected/completed) into CausalChain with metadata (`delegation.selected_agent`, `delegation.rationale`, etc.).
- Environment-driven delegation settings: threshold (`CCOS_DELEGATION_THRESHOLD`), max candidates, min skill hits, enable flag.
- Introduced `task_protocol.rs` with `TaskRequest` and `TaskResult` (bootstrap for M5).
- Updated `process_request` to invoke feedback after delegated plan execution outcome.
- Updated completion report & issue body to mark M4 & M5 done and list follow-ups.
- Parser stability adjustments (earlier this cycle): refined type multi‑predicate & regex literal handling.

## Current Implementation Snapshot

- Arbiter (`arbiter.rs`): Template NL → Intent + Plan path; deterministic plan scaffolding.
- DelegatingArbiter (`delegating_arbiter.rs`): Optional pre‑LLM agent delegation (heuristic scoring via `AgentRegistry`), fallback to LLM model (`stub-model` deterministic for CI). Produces Intent JSON + RTFS Plan.
- Governance / Pipeline (`ccos/mod.rs`): Preflight capability validation, sanitation, scaffolding, constitutional validation, execution orchestration, delegation feedback hook.
- AgentRegistry (`agent_registry.rs`): In-memory implementation with heuristic scoring & rolling success rate (`record_feedback`).
- Delegation Events: All lifecycle phases appended to `CausalChain` with signatures.
- Task Protocol (`task_protocol.rs`): Data structures in place (wiring to orchestrator is a follow-up task).
- Capability Marketplace: Central broker for capability invocation; preflight validator scans plan for unknown capability ids.
- Parser: Supports refined type intersections & regex predicates with literal grammar adjustments.

## Environment / Configuration

- Enable DelegatingArbiter: `CCOS_USE_DELEGATING_ARBITER=1`
- Delegation model (deterministic): `CCOS_DELEGATING_MODEL=stub-model` (or `echo-model`)
- Delegation threshold override: `CCOS_DELEGATION_THRESHOLD` (default 0.65)

## Testing Status

- Integration & E2E suites passing pre-rebase (includes delegation lifecycle + governance veto tests).
- Deterministic `stub-model` ensures reproducible plan generation for CI.
- Delegation tests assert presence/order of lifecycle events including `completed`.

## Checklist (mirrors issue milestones)

- [x] M1 LLM execution bridge (`(llm-execute ...)`) with security gating.
- [x] M2 Natural language → Intent & Plan (templates + LLM path, deterministic model for CI).
- [x] M3 Dynamic capability resolution via marketplace (preflight validation step).
- [x] M4 Agent Registry & Delegation Lifecycle
  - In-memory `AgentRegistry` with heuristic scoring & env overrides.
  - Delegation events: proposed / approved / rejected / completed.
  - Governance validation hook (`validate_delegation`).
  - Feedback loop updates rolling success statistics post execution.
- [x] M5 Task Delegation Protocol Bootstrap
  - `TaskRequest` / `TaskResult` structs defined (`task_protocol.rs`).
  - Placeholder for orchestrator dispatch (follow-up wiring planned).

## Milestones and Acceptance Criteria (Delivered)

- M1: `(llm-execute ...)` intrinsic operational & tested.
- M2: DelegatingArbiter generates valid Intent + executable RTFS Plan; deterministic model ensures reproducibility.
- M3: Preflight capability validation rejects unknown capability references early.
- M4: Delegation path attempts agent selection (threshold-based), records lifecycle events, governance may veto, completed event + feedback metrics captured.
- M5: Task Protocol bootstrap structures ready for integration (scoped to data model this milestone).

## Risks and Dependencies

- Capability extraction currently token-based; AST-based extraction would reduce false positives (planned follow-up).
- Task Protocol not yet wired into orchestrator dispatch (future enhancement).
- Delegation metadata keys not centrally enumerated; risk of drift if extended widely.

## Post-Completion Follow-Ups (Planned Enhancements)

1. AST-based capability extraction replacing tokenizer heuristic.
2. Wire `TaskRequest` / `TaskResult` through orchestrator + ledger logging.
3. Specification docs updates: delegation lifecycle & task protocol semantics (`docs/ccos/specs/`).
4. Centralize delegation metadata key constants.
5. Additional negative tests (sub-threshold agent path, malformed delegation metadata rejection scenarios).
6. Configurable adaptive delegation threshold based on rolling success stats.
