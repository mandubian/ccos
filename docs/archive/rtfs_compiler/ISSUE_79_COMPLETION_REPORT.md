# Issue #79 Completion Report: Hierarchical Execution Context Management

## ✅ Phase 1 Completed

- **Issue**: #79 - Hierarchical Execution Context Management
- **Status**: Phase 1 Complete (Foundations implemented, integrations documented)
- **Completion Date**: August 9, 2025

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 delivers a working hierarchical execution context system integrated with the evaluator, documented in specs, and validated with tests. It introduces step-scoped context entry/exit, isolation semantics, and an initial checkpoint interface, while keeping host/orchestrator audit logging separate and clean. Additional polish since initial submission: step-if/step-loop now enter/exit child contexts like step, and the Merge policy performs deep merge (maps merged key-wise, vectors concatenated). Build is green and the system is ready for incremental adoption.

## Key Achievements

### 1) Core Context System
- Hierarchical context stack with parent/child relationships
- Isolation levels: Inherit, Isolated, and Sandboxed (read-only semantics captured)
- Context API: `enter_step`, `exit_step`, `set`, `get`, `serialize`, `deserialize`
- Early checkpointing hooks for future resume support

### 2) Evaluator Integration
- `(step ...)` enters a child context with appropriate isolation and exits on completion
- `(step-if ...)` and `(step-loop ...)` now enter/exit a step-scoped child context and produce lifecycle events
- `(step.parallel ...)` runs sequential branches with isolated child contexts (ready for true parallelism). Merge policy implemented via `:merge-policy` keyword: `:keep-existing` (default), `:overwrite`, `:merge` (deep: maps merged, vectors concatenated)
- Step options now support context exposure overrides: `:expose-context <bool>` and `:context-keys [..]` parsed at the start of `(step ...)` and applied step-scoped
- Added context-aware helpers `begin_isolated`/`end_isolated` to streamline branch execution and merge

### 3) Orchestrator & Host Clarity
- Renamed `runtime/host.rs` private `ExecutionContext` → `HostPlanContext` to disambiguate from hierarchical execution context
- Preserved clean separation:
  - `RuntimeContext` (security/permissions)
  - `CCOSEnvironment` (runtime container)
  - `ExecutionContext` (hierarchical execution data)
  - `HostPlanContext` (host-side plan metadata for logging)
  - Checkpointing helpers: `serialize_context`/`deserialize_context`, `checkpoint_plan` (logs PlanPaused) and `resume_plan` (logs PlanResumed)
  - Persistence: added `CheckpointArchive` and `resume_plan_from_checkpoint` to load by checkpoint id (in-memory for now)
  - Host now supports step-scoped read-only context exposure override with key filtering; uses dynamic policy (exact IDs, prefixes, tags) when attaching sanitized snapshots to capability calls

### 4) Capability Marketplace Hardening (related, unblock build)
- Introduced dyn-safe, enum-based executor registry (`ExecutorVariant`) with dispatch in `CapabilityMarketplace`
- Build restored to green; registry documented in spec 004

### 5) Documentation Delivered
- New spec: `docs/ccos/specs/015-execution-contexts.md` (roles, lifecycle, isolation, integration; includes merge-policy examples and dynamic exposure policy by IDs/prefixes/tags; step-level overrides)
- Cross-links: `000-ccos-architecture.md`, `014-step-special-form-design.md` (documents `:merge-policy`)
- Updated: `docs/ccos/specs/004-capabilities-and-marketplace.md` (executor registry design)

### 6) Tests
- Added `execution_context_tests.rs` covering creation, isolation behavior, basic serialization, child/parent visibility, and merge behavior (parent-wins default, overwrite manual, keyword-driven overwrite via `:merge-policy`)
- Added `orchestrator_checkpoint_tests.rs` verifying checkpoint/resume helpers serialize/restore context, log `PlanPaused`/`PlanResumed`, and resume via stored checkpoint id
- Added evaluator-level tests:
  - `ccos_context_exposure_tests.rs`: validates context exposure to capabilities with security policy and step-level overrides (`:expose-context`, `:context-keys`) via `ccos.echo`
  - `step_parallel_merge_tests.rs`: asserts deep-merge policy for nested maps and vector concatenation across parallel branches
  - `checkpoint_resume_tests.rs`: enables durable checkpoints via `with_durable_dir` and verifies resume-by-id
- Verified evaluator primitives with new step-if/step-loop context handling; overall suite remains stable (known unrelated failures tracked separately)

## Detailed Results

- Context stack APIs support nested steps with clear parent→child data visibility semantics
- Evaluator wires `(step ...)` entry/exit; `(step.parallel ...)` uses isolated child contexts (sequential for now)
- Serialization supports simple values; complex `MapKey` handling deferred to future checkpoint/resume workstreams
- Dynamic exposure policy: exact capability ID allowlist, namespace prefixes (e.g., `ccos.ai.`), and capability metadata tags; enforced at call-time via capability manifest lookup
- Step-level overrides: `:expose-context` and `:context-keys` honored per step, applied and cleared reliably on success/error
- Build: green; warnings exist but are unrelated to this feature and are logged for future cleanup

## Implementation Highlights

1. Module: `rtfs_compiler/src/ccos/execution_context.rs`
   - Core types: `ContextManager`, `ContextStack`, `ExecutionContext`, `IsolationLevel`
   - APIs for step-scoped entry/exit, get/set, serialize/deserialize

2. Evaluator: `rtfs_compiler/src/runtime/evaluator.rs`
   - Step special form integrates context entry/exit
   - Parallel form uses isolated child contexts (sequential execution to preserve determinism; ready for async)

3. Host: `rtfs_compiler/src/runtime/host.rs`
   - `ExecutionContext` renamed to `HostPlanContext` (plan_id, intent_ids, parent_action_id)

4. Marketplace: `rtfs_compiler/src/runtime/capability_marketplace.rs`
   - Enum-based executor registry and dispatch before provider fallback

5. Specs
   - `015-execution-contexts.md` (new)
   - Cross-links in `000` and integration section in `014`
   - `004` updated with executor registry model

## Quality Metrics

- Build: ✅ Green
- Tests: ✅ New execution context tests pass (alongside existing suites)
- Lints: ⚠️ Non-blocking warnings remain (tracked for cleanup)
- Docs: ✅ Added/updated with cross-references and examples

## Production Readiness

- Status: Developer Preview for orchestrated plans using `(step ...)`
- Safe to adopt in non-critical paths; parallel/merge semantics will mature in Phase 2
- Audit logging remains cleanly separated via host/causal chain

## Impact Assessment

- Enables step-scoped state with clear isolation, setting the stage for robust orchestration flows
- Establishes consistent conceptual separation among runtime/security/environment/context layers
- Provides a foundation for checkpoint/resume and human-in-the-loop governance

## Next Steps (Incoming Work)

1. True Parallel Execution
   - Implement concurrent branch execution for `(step.parallel ...)` with isolated child contexts
   - Deterministic aggregation and error handling (fail-fast vs. best-effort)
    - Prepare evaluator-safe parallel scaffolding (separate child evaluators and environments per branch)

2. Merge Policies
   - Parent-wins and child-wins implemented; `:merge` now performs deep merge for maps (key-wise) and concatenates vectors
   - Extend `:merge` to support user-defined resolvers and typed/validated merges

3. Checkpoint/Resume
   - In-memory `CheckpointArchive` implemented with id-based lookup; integrate durable Plan Archive next
   - Expose orchestrator resume entrypoint to load checkpoint by id across process boundaries
   - Governance on checkpoint creation/resume (policy hooks)

4. Capability Context Access
    - Read-only context exposure to capabilities via `HostInterface` with dynamic policy and step overrides
    - Enforce immutability and attestation when context-derived data is used
    - Make override stack-safe for nested steps (DONE)

5. Policy & Governance
   - Validate `IsolationLevel` choices against `RuntimeContext` policy at step entry
   - Constitution checks for sensitive merges and propagation

6. Evaluator Coverage & Tests
   - Ensure `step.if`, `step.loop`, and error paths properly enter/exit contexts
    - Add tests for nested steps, conflict merges, context exposure overrides, and resume scenarios

7. Performance & Ergonomics
   - Depth limits, diff-based serialization, memory bounds
   - Context Horizon/Working Memory handoff for large state

## Lessons Learned

- Keep security (`RuntimeContext`) and execution data (`ExecutionContext`) strictly separated
- Async traits complicate dyn registries; enum-based dispatch provides a simple, robust alternative
- Early doc integration reduces confusion and accelerates adoption

## Conclusion

Phase 1 lays a solid foundation for hierarchical execution contexts, cleanly integrated with evaluator, orchestrator, and documentation. With parallel execution, merge policies, and checkpoint/resume queued next, the system is positioned to deliver full intent-driven orchestration with verifiable auditability and safe, step-scoped state.
