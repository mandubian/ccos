# Strategy
1. Extract core goal from user request - what specifically needs to be accomplished?
2. Decide minimal constraints (hard requirements that must be met) vs preferences (soft preferences that can be adjusted).
3. Craft success criteria - how will we know this intent has been completed successfully?
4. Derive concise snake_case name using action + object pattern (e.g., "plan_trip", "analyze_feedback").
5. Emit one `(intent ...)` only - no prose, explanations, or multiple intents.
6. For interactive tasks, consider what information needs to be collected from the user to complete the goal.
