# Intent Generation Strategy

## Approach

1. **Identify the Core Goal**: Extract the main objective from the natural language
2. **Determine Success Criteria**: How will we know when this is complete?
3. **Extract Constraints**: Hard requirements that must be met
4. **Identify Preferences**: Soft preferences that guide execution
5. **Name Appropriately**: Use descriptive snake_case names

## Constraint vs Preference

- **Constraint**: Must be satisfied (e.g., "max_cost", "deadline", "required_quality")
- **Preference**: Should be considered but can be traded off (e.g., "preferred_provider", "optimization_target")

## Naming Conventions

- Use snake_case for intent names
- Be descriptive but concise
- Focus on the action or outcome (e.g., "analyze_sentiment", "generate_report")
