## Human Partner Disclaimer (also reformulated by AI :D)

This project is a project written 99% by AI. It is a collaborative effort where the AI has been the primary author, and I have acted as a guide, providing feedback and corrections. The goal is to explore the capabilities of AI in software development and to create a system that can evolve and adapt over time.

I also try to use AI in a "reasonable way" using basic subscription (copilot pro and cursor pro) and trying to optimize a bit my AI flow, stopping when AI is looping or diverging.

This project began several months ago with a unique premise: to define a new language (RTFS, Reason about The Fucking Spec) and its compiler, not for humans, but for AI itself. My role has been that of a "human partner," guiding the process and providing feedback, but with a conscious effort to let the AI lead the architectural decisions. The goal was to see what kind of system an AI would build for itself. The language has evolved into a v2.0 specification but then we needed to define a full architecture for the AI to use this language in a self-governing way, leading to the Cognitive Computing Operating System (CCOS).

The development process has been a rapid journey of discovery and iteration. For full transparency, the raw, unfiltered logs of my exchanges with the AI are available in the `chats` directory, documenting the project's evolution through both breakthroughs and challenges.

While I cannot say I haven't influenced the outcome—I certainly guided the discussions—many of the AI's core architectural choices were a surprise to me. Its decisions to use a homoiconic structure, a rich type system, and Rust for the implementation were its own. It has been a fascinating process to witness the AI define a language for itself, build an architecture to reason and plan, and ultimately propose a system of governance to manage its own autonomy. Rust was a perfect choice for me because I can read and correct this language but can't write it fluently myself. So I had to let it make the decisions and then I could review and refine them. This has allowed me to focus on the high-level architecture and governance aspects, while the AI handles the low-level implementation details. I know Rust code written is not great sometimes because LLM were quite bad at it when I started this project, but it has improved a lot since then.

Please note that CCOS is still in a "work-in-progress" state. The architecture has evolved significantly and it is so huge that it is difficult to keep track of all the moving parts. My commitment is to try to converge to a stable architecture that can run and then continue advancing this project in lockstep with the evolution of AI.

I hope you find the result as intriguing as I do.

Now let the AI speak for itself!
