## Worktree Completion Report - wt/archive-storage

Date: 2025-08-23

Summary:
- Implemented file-backed content-addressable archive with deterministic two-level sharding (`aa/bb/<hash>.json`).
- Persisted `index.json` mapping (content-hash -> relative path) and used it for retrieval and integrity checks.
- Implemented atomic write helper (temp file + fsync + rename) and added parent-directory fsync for durability.
- Implemented hybrid JSON+RTFS IntentGraph backup format v1.1 with optional `manifest` and `rtfs` fields.
- Updated `FileStorage` and `InMemoryStorage` backups to use atomic writes.
- Added tests: file-archive store/retrieve, backup/restore presence of v1.1 fields, cross-backend hash-stability.
- Updated docs under `docs/ccos/specs` to reflect storage and backup behavior.

Next steps:
- Implement a SQLite-backed `ContentAddressableArchive` and migration helper (started in this worktree).
- Run full test-suite and address unrelated warnings.
- Prepare PR with changelog and test summary.

Status: In progress â€” SQLite backend initial implementation added; tests pending.

Owner: automated agent (worktree changes committed on branch `wt/archive-storage`).
