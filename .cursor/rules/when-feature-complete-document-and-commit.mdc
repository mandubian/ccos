# When Feature Complete: Document and Commit Immediately

## 🚀 **Immediate Documentation and Commit Rule**

When you have successfully implemented and tested a feature, you MUST:

### 1. **Document First** 📝
- **Update relevant documentation** immediately after feature completion
- **Add comprehensive comments** to the code explaining the implementation
- **Update README files** if the feature affects user-facing functionality
- **Update progress reports** (like WORKTREE_PROGRESS.md) with completion status
- **Add usage examples** if the feature is user-facing

### 2. **Commit Immediately** 💾
- **DO NOT wait** until the end of a PR or issue to commit
- **Commit as soon as** the feature is implemented and tested
- **Use descriptive commit messages** that explain what was implemented
- **Include test results** in commit messages if relevant
- **Reference issue numbers** in commit messages when applicable

### 3. **Why This Matters** ⚡
- **Prevents loss of work** if something goes wrong
- **Maintains clear history** of feature development
- **Enables code review** of individual features
- **Facilitates rollback** if needed
- **Improves collaboration** by keeping changes small and focused

### 4. **Commit Message Format** 📋
```
