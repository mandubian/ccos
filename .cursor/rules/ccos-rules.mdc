# CCOS Compliance Quick Reference

- Specs live in `docs/ccos/specs/`. Core refs: `000` architecture, `001` intent graph, `002` orchestration, `003` causal chain, `004` capabilities, `014` step form, `017` checkpoint/resume.
- RTFS/CCOS wiring: follow `.cursor/rules/rtfs-2.0-rules.mdc` plus `docs/rtfs-2.0/specs/13-rtfs-ccos-integration-guide.md`.
- Intent → Plan → Action chain is mandatory. Log every step via CCOS causal chain primitives.
- Plans must stay immutable post-archive; resume flows use checkpoint spec `017`.
- Capability calls require attestation checks and marketplace registration (`004`, `011`).
- Always enforce security gates: intent sanitization (`012`), governance (`010`), context limits (`009`), working memory rules (`013`).
- Delegation must use Arbiter / Delegation Engine patterns (`006`, `008`) and respect human-in-loop pauses when flagged.
- Never bypass intent graph, causal chain, capability attestation, or CCOS step special form; doing so violates core compliance.
