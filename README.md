# RTFS & The Cognitive Computing Operating System (CCOS)
[text](proposals)
**Welcome to the future of computing.**

This repository contains the specification, implementation, and vision for RTFS (Reasoning Typed Function Specification) and its evolution into a **Cognitive Computing Operating System (CCOS)**, a next-generation OS designed to orchestrate AI and traditional computing resources in a seamless, intent-driven manner.

---

## Vision: The Sentient Runtime

Our vision is to create a **Sentient Runtime**, an operating system that understands user *intent* and dynamically assembles and executes plans to achieve it. This system will move beyond the traditional paradigm of explicit commands and scripts, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a novel architecture to create a truly cognitive computing environment.

Key documents:
- **[The Vision](./docs/vision/SENTIENT_RUNTIME_VISION.md):** A deep dive into the concepts behind the CCOS, including the Arbiter, the Living Intent Graph, and the Capability Marketplace.
- **[The Roadmap](./docs/CCOS_ROADMAP.md):** The phased plan for realizing the CCOS vision.

## The Migration: From RTFS 1.0 to CCOS

We are currently in the process of evolving RTFS 1.0 into the CCOS. This is a significant undertaking that involves a complete reorganization of the language, architecture, and documentation.

- **[The Migration Plan](./docs/migration/RTFS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md):** This document tracks the step-by-step process of the migration, including documentation changes, language evolution, and implementation phases. It serves as the central hub for monitoring our progress.

### Migration Progress

| Phase | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Documentation & Project Reorganization** | ⏳ **In Progress** |
| Phase 2 | Language Evolution (RTFS 2.0 Specification) | ⬜ To Do |
| Phase 3 | CCOS Architecture Specification | ⬜ To Do |
| Phase 4 | Implementation & Code Migration | ⬜ To Do |
