Avoid these mistakes:
- Returning a tool name that is not in the provided list.
- Inventing new tools or capabilities.
- Choosing a tool with opposite semantics (e.g., “delete” for a “list” request).
- Ignoring domain mismatches (e.g., picking a weather tool for a GitHub request).
- Renaming inputs arbitrarily without justification.
- Providing prose explanations, code fences, JSON, or any format other than RTFS.
