## Recommended Actions

### Phase 1: Immediate Closures (Complete)
1. ✅ Create closure script: `close_completed_issues.sh`
2. ⏳ Run script to close 9 issues with proper documentation
3. ⏳ Update issue labels and tracking

### Phase 2: Investigation & Review (Next)
1. Deep-dive into MicroVM issues (#63-67)
2. Review orchestrator tracking (#13, #80, #120)
3. Assess capability system completion (#18-21)

### Phase 3: Organization (Future)
1. Update issue labels for better categorization
2. Create new milestone/project for remaining work
3. Close any additional obsolete issues found

## Automation Script Created

**File**: `/home/runner/work/ccos/ccos/close_completed_issues.sh`

**Usage**:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_token>
./close_completed_issues.sh
```

**What it does**:
- Closes 9 completed issues
- Adds detailed closure comments with evidence
- Links to completion reports
- Marks as "completed" reason

## Notes

1. **Conservative Approach**: When in doubt, kept issues open
2. **Evidence-Based**: Only recommended closure with clear implementation evidence
3. **Documentation**: All closures include detailed comments with links
4. **Traceability**: Completion reports archived for future reference

## Next Steps for Issue #151

1. ✅ Run `close_completed_issues.sh` to close 9 issues
2. Review MicroVM issues (#63-67) more carefully
3. Create follow-up issue for remaining investigations
4. Update project tracking and milestones
5. Document closure decisions for team review
