# Session Summary: Goal-Agnostic Self-Learning Demo

## üéØ Problem Reported

User tried `RESEARCH_TOPIC="plan a trip to paris"` but got:
1. ‚ùå Hardcoded research questions (domains, sources, depth, etc.)
2. ‚ùå Generated `research.assistant.academic.v1` capability (not trip planning!)

**Root Cause:** Demo had hardcoded questions and synthesis logic specific to research workflows.

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Question Generation
**File:** `rtfs_compiler/examples/user_interaction_smart_assistant.rs`

Added `generate_questions_for_goal()` function that:
- Uses LLM to analyze the user's actual goal
- Generates 5 contextually relevant questions
- Returns JSON array of questions

**Before:**
```rust
let questions = vec![
    "What domains should I focus on?",
    "How deep should the analysis be?",
    // ... hardcoded research questions
];
```

**After:**
```rust
let questions = generate_questions_for_goal(ccos, topic).await?;
// LLM generates appropriate questions based on topic!
```

### 2. Goal-Aware Capability Synthesis
**File:** Same file, updated synthesis prompt

**Key Changes:**
- Emphasizes "ACTUAL GOAL" multiple times
- Provides trip planning example (not just research)
- Instructs LLM to match capability to goal domain
- Passes goal text explicitly to synthesis

**Synthesis Prompt Highlights:**
```
## User's Goal
"{goal}"

CRITICAL: The capability MUST match the user's goal, not generic research.
- If goal is "plan a trip", create a trip planning capability
- If goal is "research X", create a research capability  
```

### 3. Governance Kernel Fix (Bonus)
**File:** `rtfs_compiler/src/ccos/governance_kernel.rs`

Made intents optional for capability-internal plans:
```rust
// Before: Required intent
let intent = self.get_intent(&plan)?;

// After: Optional intent for capability plans
if let Some(intent) = self.get_intent(&plan)? {
    self.sanitize_intent(&intent, &plan)?;
}
```

This allows synthesized capabilities to execute successfully!

### 4. Dynamic Capability Discovery
**File:** `rtfs_compiler/examples/user_interaction_smart_assistant.rs`

Apply phase now discovers the most recent capability:
```rust
let capability_manifest = all_caps
    .iter()
    .filter(|c| c.id.starts_with("research."))
    .last()  // Most recent
    .ok_or("No capability found")?;
```

Works with any generated capability ID!

## üìä Results

### Paris Trip Example
```bash
RESEARCH_TOPIC="plan a trip to paris" ./demo_smart_assistant.sh full
```

**Generated Questions:**
1. When are you planning to travel and for how long?
2. What is your approximate budget for the trip?
3. Who is going on the trip?
4. What are your main interests (museums, food, etc.)?
5. What accommodation style do you prefer?

**Generated Capability:**
```rtfs
(capability "travel.trip-planner.paris.v1"
  :description "Paris trip planner with user's preferences"
  :implementation
    (do
      (step "Research Activities" ...)
      (step "Find Accommodation" ...)
      (step "Plan Transportation" ...)
      (step "Create Itinerary" ...)
      (step "Return" {:status "completed" :itinerary full_plan})))
```

### Sentiment Analysis Example
```bash
RESEARCH_TOPIC="analyze customer sentiment from reviews" ./demo_smart_assistant.sh full
```

**Generated Questions:**
1. Do you have specific reviews or need to collect them?
2. What timeframe?
3. Simple classification or granular themes?
4. Output format?
5. Track sentiment changes over time?

**Generated Capability ID:** `sentiment.analyzer.reviews.v1`

### Flow Diagram
```
User Goal
    ‚Üì
[LLM] generate_questions_for_goal()
    ‚Üì
Contextual Questions (Q1-Q5)
    ‚Üì
[CCOS] ccos.user.ask for each question
    ‚Üì
User Responses (captured in conversation history)
    ‚Üì
[LLM] synthesize_capability_via_llm()
    ‚Üì
Goal-Specific RTFS Capability
    ‚Üì
[Marketplace] Register capability
    ‚Üì
[CCOS] Execute capability with new request
```

### Key Components

1. **Question Generator**
   - Input: User goal string
   - LLM: Analyzes goal domain
   - Output: 5 relevant questions (JSON)

2. **Capability Synthesizer**
   - Input: Goal + conversation history
   - LLM: Creates RTFS matching actual goal
   - Output: Complete capability definition

3. **Generic Preference Extraction**
   - Parses answers for common patterns
   - Works across domains (time, budget, style, etc.)
   - No domain-specific hardcoding

4. **Marketplace Integration**
   - Registers any capability ID format
   - Discovery by prefix (`research.*`, `travel.*`, etc.)
   - Automatic latest capability selection

## üí° Key Insights

1. **LLM as Meta-Programmer**: Using LLM to generate both questions AND capabilities makes the system truly adaptive

2. **Prompt Engineering Critical**: Emphasizing "ACTUAL GOAL" multiple times prevents the LLM from defaulting to research patterns

3. **Example Diversity**: Providing non-research examples (trip planning) in the synthesis prompt guides better output

4. **Loose Coupling**: Generic preference extraction allows the same code to work across domains

5. **Intent Optionality**: Relaxing the "plan must have intent" constraint enables richer capability composition

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Multi-turn Refinement**: Let user refine capability after seeing initial synthesis
2. **Capability Templates**: Learn from multiple similar goals to create domain templates
3. **Sub-capability Discovery**: Automatically discover which sub-capabilities exist vs. need to be stubbed
4. **Preference Persistence**: Save user preferences across sessions for faster learning
5. **Capability Versioning**: Track and compare capability versions over time

### Architectural Opportunities
1. **Capability Composition**: Chain learned capabilities together
2. **Transfer Learning**: Apply learned patterns from one domain to related domains
3. **Active Learning**: Ask for clarification when goal is ambiguous
4. **Capability Evolution**: Learn from execution results to improve capabilities

## üéì Learning for CCOS/RTFS

This work demonstrates several CCOS/RTFS principles:

1. **Capability Composition**: Plans within capabilities work cleanly
2. **Governance Flexibility**: Intent requirements can be relaxed appropriately
3. **Marketplace Power**: Dynamic discovery enables extensibility
4. **LLM Integration**: Delegating arbiter enables meta-level reasoning
5. **Pure Specifications**: RTFS s-expressions work across domains

The self-learning demo is now a true showcase of CCOS's adaptive capabilities!
