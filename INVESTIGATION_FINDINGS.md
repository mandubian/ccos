## Evidence Collected

### Implementation Verification

**Step Forms (Issue #78)**:
```bash
$ grep -r "step-if\|step-loop\|step-parallel" rtfs_compiler/src --include="*.rs" -l
rtfs_compiler/src/ir/converter.rs
rtfs_compiler/src/runtime/evaluator.rs
```

**Delegation Infrastructure (Issues #87, #94, #96)**:
```bash
rtfs_compiler/src/ccos/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ delegation.rs              # DelegationConfig (#87)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ delegation_keys.rs         # Metadata constants (#94)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ delegation_l4.rs           # Additional delegation logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task_protocol.rs           # Task protocol stubs (#92)
```

**MicroVM Providers (Issues #63-67)**:
```bash
rtfs_compiler/src/runtime/microvm/providers/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firecracker.rs (46KB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gvisor.rs (17KB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process.rs (15KB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wasm.rs (6KB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mock.rs (8KB)

# Missing: No IsolatedAgent struct found
$ find rtfs_compiler/src -name "*.rs" -exec grep -l "struct IsolatedAgent" {} \;
[No results]
```

## Updated Statistics

### Before Investigation
- Close Now: 9 issues
- Review Needed: 10 issues
- Keep Open: 57 issues

### After Investigation  
- Close Now: **11 issues** (+2)
- Already Closed: **3 issues** (found during investigation)
- Review Needed: **8 issues** (-2)
- Keep Open: **55 issues** (-2, moved to closed)

### Net Change
- Ready to close: +2 issues (#80, #120)
- Found already closed: +3 issues (#87, #94, #96)
- Confirmed keep open: -5 issues (moved from review to keep/closed)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Update closure script with #80 and #120
2. ‚úÖ Update manual guide with #80 and #120
3. ‚úÖ Update analysis report with findings
4. ‚è≥ Execute closure script (11 issues total)

### Short-Term Actions
1. Continue monitoring #63-67 (MicroVM) - significant work remains
2. Review #91-95 for prioritization
3. Consider creating new umbrella issue for MicroVM agent isolation

### Long-Term Actions
1. Periodic audits (quarterly) to catch completed work
2. Improve issue lifecycle management
3. Better tracking of completion reports

## Closure Script Updates

Added to `close_completed_issues.sh`:
- Issue #80 with detailed comment about children
- Issue #120 with explanation of organizational purpose

Added to `MANUAL_CLOSURE_GUIDE.md`:
- Section for Issue #80
- Section for Issue #120
- Updated checklist

## Conclusion

Investigation successfully identified 2 additional issues ready for closure and confirmed 3 issues were already closed. This brings the total from 9 to **11 issues ready to close**.

The investigation also confirmed that 8 issues flagged for review should remain open as valid future work, and provided clear evidence for all decisions.

**Final Count**: 11 issues to close, 3 already closed (no action), 8 confirmed to keep open.
