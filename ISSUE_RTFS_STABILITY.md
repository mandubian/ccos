# Issue: RTFS Language Stability and Standard Library Implementation

## Summary
Following the completion of Issue #45 (End-to-End Grammar Feature Test Matrix), comprehensive testing revealed multiple areas where the RTFS compiler needs stabilization and enhancement. This issue tracks the systematic resolution of these identified problems to achieve full RTFS language compliance.

## Background
The end-to-end test execution revealed 385+ test cases across 14 feature categories, with specific failure patterns indicating both missing standard library functions and core language feature gaps. While basic language constructs work correctly, several critical areas need attention for production readiness.

## Identified Issues

### Priority 1: Missing Standard Library Functions
**Impact**: UndefinedSymbol errors across multiple test categories
**Functions Needed**:
- `println` - Basic output functionality
- `nth` - Vector/list element access
- `thread/sleep` - Concurrency operations
- `read-lines` - File I/O operations
- `step` - Iterator functionality
- `first`, `rest` - Sequence operations
- `range` - Numeric sequence generation
- `map`, `filter`, `reduce` - Higher-order functions

### Priority 2: Variable Scoping Issues
**Impact**: Variable resolution failures in complex expressions
**Problems**:
- Let expression variable binding scope
- Pattern matching variable capture
- Function parameter scoping
- Nested scope resolution

### Priority 3: Parser Enhancement
**Impact**: Parsing failures for advanced language features
**Problems**:
- Advanced literal parsing (##Inf, ##-Inf, complex numbers)
- RTFS 2.0 special form support
- Multi-line expression parsing
- Comment handling in complex expressions

### Priority 4: Runtime Strategy Consistency
**Impact**: Behavioral differences between AST and IR runtime strategies
**Problems**:
- Error handling consistency
- Performance characteristics
- Memory management
- Exception propagation

### Priority 5: Type System Enhancement
**Impact**: Type checking and inference improvements needed
**Problems**:
- Generic type support
- Union type handling
- Type constraint validation
- Runtime type checking

## Test Results Analysis

### Successful Categories
- Basic arithmetic and literals
- Simple function definitions
- Basic control flow (if/then/else)
- Vector creation and basic operations

### Failing Categories
- Advanced function operations (94% failure rate)
- Complex let expressions (89% failure rate)
- Standard library dependent operations (100% failure rate)
- Advanced pattern matching (78% failure rate)
- RTFS 2.0 special forms (85% failure rate)
