docs(spec): Clarify set! behavior in intent graphs

Clarify that the CCOS Orchestrator is responsible for promoting
variables set with 'set!' into a cross-plan shared context. This
is a platform-level mechanism designed to simplify plan generation
for LLMs, abstracting away the underlying implementation.

Also updates examples to use idiomatic keyword keys (e.g., :key)
instead of string keys for set!/get, aligning with recent
evaluator improvements.
