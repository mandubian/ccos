;; Test file for RTFS Capability System
;; This file demonstrates how to use the new capability architecture

;; Test 1: Basic echo capability
(let [result1 (call :ccos.echo "Hello World!")]
  (call :ccos.io.log (str "Echo result: " result1)))

;; Test 2: Math capability with structured input
(let [result2 (call :ccos.math.add {:a 10 :b 20})]
  (call :ccos.io.log (str "Math result: " result2)))

;; Test 3: Human interaction capability
(let [prompt (call :ccos.ask-human "What is your name?")]
  (call :ccos.io.log (str "Human prompt created: " prompt)))

;; Test 4: Capability with options
(let [result4 (call :ccos.echo "Test with options" {:timeout 5000})]
  (call :ccos.io.log (str "Echo with options: " result4)))

;; Test 5: Plan with multiple capability calls
(plan capability-test-plan
  :description "Test plan demonstrating various capabilities"
  :intent-id "test-capability-intent"
  :steps [
    (call :ccos.io.log "Starting capability test plan")
    (let [sum (call :ccos.math.add {:a 5 :b 3})]
      (call :ccos.io.log (str "Step 1: Calculated sum = " sum)))
    (let [echo-result (call :ccos.echo "Step 2: Echo test")]
      (call :ccos.io.log (str "Step 2: Echo result = " echo-result)))
    (call :ccos.io.log "Step 3: Plan completed successfully")
  ])
