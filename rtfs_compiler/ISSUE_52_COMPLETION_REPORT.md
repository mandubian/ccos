## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Symbol Resolution Enhancement
**Problem**: IR runtime couldn't resolve standard library functions  
**Solution**: Enhanced IR converter with stdlib module lookup  
**Impact**: Complete functional parity between runtimes  

### 2. Function Display Compatibility  
**Problem**: AST and IR runtimes showed functions differently  
**Solution**: Unified debug display format showing "Function(Closure)"  
**Impact**: Consistent behavior for debugging and testing  

### 3. Keyword-as-Function Pattern
**Problem**: (:keyword map) syntax not working in IR runtime  
**Solution**: Implemented keyword function calls in IR apply_function  
**Impact**: Advanced RTFS syntax patterns working across all runtimes  

### 4. Parse Error Handling
**Problem**: Tests expecting parse failures weren't handled properly  
**Solution**: Enhanced test infrastructure to handle compilation failures  
**Impact**: Comprehensive test coverage including negative test cases  

### 5. Standard Library Expansion
**Problem**: Missing core functions causing undefined symbol errors  
**Solution**: Added comprehensive function aliases and new implementations  
**Impact**: Full standard library compatibility and backward compatibility
