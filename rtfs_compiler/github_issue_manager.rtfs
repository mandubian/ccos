    :body "## Overview

Create a comprehensive RTFS library that provides bindings for all Intent Graph functions, enabling RTFS programs to interact with the Intent Graph system directly.

## Background

Currently, all Intent Graph operations are implemented in Rust but lack RTFS bindings. This creates a gap where RTFS programs cannot directly:
- Create and manage intents
- Build and traverse intent relationships  
- Store and restore intent subgraphs
- Query intent hierarchies and metadata

## Requirements

### 1. Core Intent Management Functions
- `(create-intent name goal constraints preferences)`
- `(update-intent intent-id updates)`
- `(delete-intent intent-id)`
- `(get-intent intent-id)`
- `(find-intents-by-goal goal-pattern)`

### 2. Relationship Management Functions
- `(create-edge from-intent to-intent edge-type weight metadata)`
- `(update-edge edge-id updates)`
- `(delete-edge edge-id)`
- `(get-edges-for-intent intent-id)`
- `(get-relationship-strength from-intent to-intent)`

### 3. Graph Traversal Functions
- `(get-parent-intents intent-id)`
- `(get-child-intents intent-id)`
- `(get-intent-hierarchy intent-id)`
- `(get-strongly-connected-intents intent-id)`
- `(find-intents-by-relationship edge-type)`

### 4. Subgraph Operations
- `(store-subgraph-from-root root-intent-id file-path)`
- `(store-subgraph-from-child child-intent-id file-path)`
- `(restore-subgraph file-path)`
- `(backup-graph file-path)`

### 5. Advanced Query Functions
- `(query-intents-by-metadata metadata-filters)`
- `(get-intent-statistics)`
- `(find-circular-dependencies)`
- `(get-orphaned-intents)`

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Function Bindings
1. Create RTFS function stubs for all core operations
2. Implement proper error handling and validation
3. Add comprehensive type checking for inputs/outputs
4. Create integration tests with the Rust Intent Graph

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Implement graph visualization helpers
2. Add batch operations for efficiency
3. Create intent templates and patterns
4. Add performance monitoring and caching

### Phase 3: Integration & Documentation
1. Create comprehensive RTFS documentation
2. Add examples and tutorials
3. Integrate with CCOS Arbiter for automated intent management
4. Create migration tools for existing intent data

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All Intent Graph functions have RTFS bindings
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Full documentation with examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Integration with CCOS Arbiter working
- [ ] Migration path for existing data

## Dependencies

- Issue #2: Intent Graph enhancements (âœ… COMPLETED)
- RTFS Compiler capability system
- CCOS Intent Graph Rust implementation

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 weeks  
- **Phase 3**: 1 week
- **Total**: 4-6 weeks

## Related Issues

- [Issue #2: Support parent-child and arbitrary relationships in Intent Graph](https://github.com/mandubian/ccos/issues/2) - âœ… COMPLETED
- Future: Integration with CCOS Arbiter for automated intent management

## Notes

This library will be a critical component for enabling RTFS programs to fully leverage the Intent Graph system, making CCOS more accessible and powerful for developers."
