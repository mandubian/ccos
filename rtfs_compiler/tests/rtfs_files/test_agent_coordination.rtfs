; RTFS Advanced Real-World Example: Distributed Agent Coordination System
; This example demonstrates advanced RTFS features for multi-agent task coordination:
; - Agent discovery and dynamic capability matching
; - Complex workflow orchestration with fault tolerance
; - Advanced pattern matching and decision trees
; - Resource sharing and coordination between agents
; - Real-time monitoring and adaptive load balancing
