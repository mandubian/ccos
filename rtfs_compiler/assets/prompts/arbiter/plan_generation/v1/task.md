### TASK
Intent: {intent}
Context: {context}
Available capabilities: {available_capabilities}

Requirements:
- Generate a complete `(plan ...)` block with all required properties
- Derive input/output schemas from the Intent's constraints and success-criteria
- Define appropriate policies based on Intent preferences
- List all capabilities required by the plan body
- Include annotations for provenance (prompt-id, version, timestamp)
- Use (step "Name" ...) for major milestones and (call :cap ...) for capability invocations
- Ensure the plan body is executable and follows RTFS 2.0 syntax
- Output only the RTFS block, nothing else
