# Configuration for MCP Tool Output Schema Introspection
#
# This file provides safe input parameters for introspecting tool output schemas.
# When output schema introspection is enabled, the system calls tools with minimal
# inputs to infer the response structure. This file specifies which safe inputs
# to use for each tool.
#
# Format:
#   [tools.<tool_name>]
#   param1 = "value1"
#   param2 = "value2"
#
# Note: Rate limiting and retry policies are configured in agent_config.toml
# under [mcp_discovery.rate_limit] and [mcp_discovery.retry_policy]
